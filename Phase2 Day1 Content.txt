Four pillars of OOPs:
1.Abstraction
2.Encapsulation
3.InheritAnce
4.Polymorphism

										ABSTRACTION:
*Hiding the implementation part and showing only what is required is called Abstraction.
*We can make class or method as abstract, opposite to abstract is concrete.
										ENCAPSULATION
*Binding data and function into a single entity
1.Public-one class info can be accessed by any other class
2.Private-can be used where it is declared/no in inhetited classes
3.Protected-can be accessed where it got declared...whichever class inherited from this class there also we can use.
										INHERITANCE
*Base class and derived class. Derived class will inherit properties of base class
*Base class-Parent class and Derived class-Child class
TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
1.Single inheritance
2.Multiple inheritance
3.Multilevel inheritance
4.Heirarical inheritance

Polymorphism:One item or same item used for different purposes
Types :
1.Overloading:
	a)Operator overloading
	b)Method overloading
2.Overriding
*If a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class it will take it from its base class or parent class
