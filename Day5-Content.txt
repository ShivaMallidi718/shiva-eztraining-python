                                              FUNCTIONS

*Classifications:
1.pre defined 
2.user defined

For code reusability , we use functions . we want to use a particular concept multiple times in our program
 instead of writing the same code many times we can write it once , nclude that inside a function and can
call the function whereever we need it.

*Types:
1.Functions without arguments, without return value
2.Functions without arguments, with return value
3.Functions with arguments, with return value
4.Functions with arguments, without return value


                                          RECURSIVE FUNCTION
*A function which calls itself is called recursive function
